   <abstract>
      JavaFX 2 marks a significant milestone in the history 
      of JavaFX. Now that Sun Microsystems has passed the 
      torch to Oracle, JavaFX Script is gone and 
      JavaFX-oriented Java APIS (such as 
      <code>javafx.application.Application</code>) have 
      emerged for interacting with this technology. This 
      article introduces you to this refactored JavaFX, 
      where you learn about JavaFX 2 architecture and key 
      APIs.
